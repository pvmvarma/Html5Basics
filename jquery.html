               <h1>Jquery introduction</h1>
                 
                        <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.</p>
               
                    
                     <h3>Advantages</h3>
               
               <p><b>Ease of use</b></p>
                    <p>This is pretty much the main advantage of using JQuery, it is a lot more easy to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries. Apart from simple syntax, it also requires much less lines of code to achieve the same feature in comparison. </p> 
               
               <p><b>Large library</b></p>
                    <p>JQuery enables you to perform hordes of functions in comparison to other Javascript libraries. </p>
               
               <p><b>Strong opensource community</b></p>
                        <p>JQuery, while relatively new, has a following that religiously devote their time to develop and enhance the functionality of JQuery. Thus there are hundreds of prewritten plugins available for download to instantly speed up your development process. Another advantage behind this is the efficiency and security of the script.</p>
               
               <p><b>Great documentation</b></p>
                    <p>The JQuery website has a comprehensive documentation and tutorials to get even an absolute beginner in programming to get the ball rolling with this library.</p>
               
               
                      <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
               
               <p><b>Functionality maybe limited</b></p>
               
                    <p>While JQuery has an impressive library in terms of quantity, depending on how much customization you require on your website, functionality maybe limited thus using raw javascript maybe inevitable in some cases. </p>
               
               <p><b>JQuery javascript file required</b></p>
                        <p>The JQuery javascript file is required to run JQuery commands, while the size of this file is relatively small (25-100KB depending on server), it is still a strain on the client computer and maybe your web server as well if you intend to host the JQuery script on your own web server.</p>

               <h1>Jquery introduction</h1>
                 
                        <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.</p>
               
                    
                     <h3>Advantages</h3>
               
               <p><b>Better interactivity</b></p>
                    <p>This is pretty much the most striking benefit behind why several developers and webmasters are switching to AJAX for their websites. AJAX allows easier and quicker interaction between user and website as pages are not reloaded for content to be displayed. </p> 
               
               <p><b>Easier navigation</b></p>
                    <p>AJAX applications on websites can be built to allow easier navigation to users in comparison to using the traditional back and forward button on a browser.</p>
               
               <p><b>Compact</b></p>
                        <p>With AJAX, several multi purpose applications and features can be handled using a single web page, avoiding the need for clutter with several web pages.</p>
               
               <p><b>Backed by reputed brands</b></p>
                    <p>Another assuring reason to use AJAX on your websites is the fact that several complex web applications are handled using AJAX, Google Maps is the most impressive and obvious example, other powerful, popular scripts such as the vBulletin forum software has also incorporated AJAX into their latest version.</p>
               
               
                      <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
               
               <p><b>The back and refresh button are rendered useless</b></p>
               
                    <p>With AJAX, as all functions are loaded on a dynamic page without the page being reloaded or more importantly a URL being changed (except for a hash symbol maybe), clicking the back or refresh button would take you to an entirely different web page or to the beginning of what your dynamic web page was processing. This is the main drawback behind AJAX but fortunately with good programming skills this issue can be fixed.</p>
               
               <p><b>It is built on javascript</b></p>
                        <p>While javascript is secure and has been heavily used by websites for a long period of time, a percentage of website surfers prefer to turn javascript functionality off on their browser rendering the AJAX application useless, a work around to this con is present as well, where the developer will need to code a parallel non-javascript version of the dynamic web page to cater to these users.</p>
